    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The wind was blowing up...</p>
    <p>Thunderstorms were appearing in the sky...</p>
    <p>And suddenly a heavy rain started...</p>
    <p>Children were scared and crying...</p>
    <p>And dogs were barking...</p>
    <p>Everybody was preoccupied...</p>
